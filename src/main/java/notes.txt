Programs:
* Product.java
* AppConfig.java
* Test.java

* @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy annotation are not belongs to Spring, those are java annotations.
* This two annotation are used at method level only.
* @PostConstruct annotated method is executed after dependency injection is done.
* @PreDestroy annotated method is executed before the instance is removed from container.
* @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy annotation are part of the standard java libraries from java6 to java8, the entire javax.annotation package got separated from the core Java modules in JDK 9 and eventually removed in JDK 11.
* As of Jakarta EE 9, the package lives in jakarta.annotation now. the you have add below artifact in pom.xml.
